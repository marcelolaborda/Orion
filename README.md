Game Description
	Game Goals
The game attempts to provide a playful and entertaining experience that is challenging enough for experienced players, yet easy to learn and play. 
Story
Orion is a small peaceful village lost in a magical forest, inhabited by fairies and mysterious creatures. Deep within the forest, there is a mighty dungeon known as the Labyrinth of the Unknown. An old man stands by the entrance of the dungeon, and asks people passing by if they can retrieve a stolen treasure from the dungeon. He explains that a prophecy foretold of a special person who would find the treasure and become the hero of Orion. The man patiently waits for the hero mentioned in the prophecy to appear.
	Game Character
Players do not control a virtual character. Instead, they play as themselves, although there is no character customization.
Gameplay
Gameplay Minute
Players start at the entrance of the dungeon. The level is a maze filled with monsters. The goal is to find the treasure and go back to the entrance of the dungeon. 
Mechanics
•	The game uses a first person perspective and dungeons are grid-based, which means that the player can only move between grid cells. Players can move forward, backward, strafe left or right, or turn in 90 degree increments.
•	Players can use their blade to damage enemies
•	It is possible to block enemy attacks by using a shield.
•	A life bar indicates how much damage the player can take. All enemy attacks do one point of damage. The player starts with 7 hit points. When the health bar is depleted, the game is over, forcing players to start back at the beginning. 
•	Health potions are necessary in order to replenish the player’s health meter. These potions are scattered throughout the level and can be used at any time. There is no limit to how many potions can be stored.
Enemies
Enemies have a specific attack pattern. They all have a weak point that is exposed to the player at specific times during combat. Hitting the enemy on any other area makes a clashing sound to give the player feedback for an unsuccessful action. However, hitting the enemy on an unprotected area or weak point reduces the enemy’s health. One successful hit reduces its health by one point. 
Rigels
Dragon-like creatures with thick turtle shells on their back and large wings. These enemies throw fireballs, but they first need to charge up, leaving an opportunity for the player to attack. 
Bellatrix
These monsters look like a cross between a bear and a dragon. Their weak point is in their stomach.
Mintaka
The final boss of the dungeon. It is a bigger and stronger version of the standard Rigel enemy.

Levels
The game includes only one dungeon in which players must battle different enemies, collect health potions, defeat a final boss, and escape from it after retrieving a hidden treasure.
